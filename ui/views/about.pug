            h2 What is Slothbucket?
            p Slothbucket is an image hosting site for only pictures of sloths. It will only accept images that have a sloth (or many sloths) in them. All of your sloth images are stored in a convenient gallery, where you can see all of them at one time.
            h2 How Does Slothbucket Know My Picture Has a Sloth in It?
            p For our human brains, recognizing what we see is pretty effortless. A computer can't do this as easily as our brains; in fact, it takes a lot of hard work and learning! However, with machine learning, computers can be trained to "see" images. Slothbucket uses one of these trained models to "see" what's in your pictures.
